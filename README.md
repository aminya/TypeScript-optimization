# TypeScript-optimization
Compares different for-loops in TypeScript/JavaScript

Benchmarks are done inside Atom (using script package) and Webstorm. Different JavaScript versions (ES2020 and ES5) are tested.

## Summary:
- Traditional `for` loops are faster.
- Don't call functions (or lookup arrays) in the head of `for` loop
- Define constant variables as constant
- Use Transformers/compilers to transform other types of `for` to traditional `for`

---------------------------

### Traditional `for` vs `for-of` vs `for-in`- Looping ovr Arrays

- ES6 and above: traditional `for` is **faster** than `for-of`. Both are much faster than `for-in`.

- ES5 and lower:Traditional `for` is **similar to** `for-of`, by `for-of` being a small touch faster. Both are much faster than `for-in`.

This is true for array of number, string, etc, and for any array size (10, 100, 1000 are tested).

If you notice, you see by targeting ES5 the TypeScript compiler converts `for-of` to the `traditional-for`, and that makes it faster than the original `for-of`!! Actually, by setting `"downlevelIteration": true
`, you can make `for-of` slow in ES5 too!!!  To fix this issue you can use `npm run build` which uses `@babel/plugin-transform-for-of` to convert `for-of` to `traditional-for` ("loose" is faster than "assumeArray").

```typescript
// Traditional
  let sum = 0
  for (let i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; ++i) {
    sum += arr[i]
  }

// for - of
  let sum = 0
  for (const a of arr) {
    sum += a
  }

// for - in
  let sum = 0
  for (const i in arr) {
    sum += arr[i]
  }
```

### Traditional `for` optimization

- in all versions: first three loop are about the same. Full array lookup in the `for-head` is very slow.

```typescript
// for-traditional
  const arr = chance.n(chance.floating, arr_length) 
  let sum = 0
  for (let i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; ++i) {
    sum += arr[i]
  }

// for-traditional-const
  const arr = chance2.n(chance2.floating, arr_length)
  let sum = 0
  const l = arr.length
  for (let i = 0; i < l; ++i) {
    sum += arr[i]
  }

// for-traditional-length-lookup
  const arr = chance3.n(chance3.floating, arr_length)
  let sum = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i) {
    sum += arr[i]
  }

// for-traditional-array-lookup
// to only measure its effect on calling inside the for-head
  let sum = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < arr_return().length; ++i) {
    sum += arr2[i] // only comparing lookup

  }
```

### `for-of` optimization

- in all versions: similar result

```typescript

  // array is made inside the function for fare comparison
  const arr = chance.n(chance.floating, arr_length)
  let sum = 0
  for (const a of arr) {
    sum += a
  }

### Traditional `for` vs `for-of` vs `for-in`- Looping ovr Objects

- ES6 and above: 
    - object size of more 17: traditional `for` is **faster** than `for-of`. Both are much faster than `for-in`.
    
    - object size of less than 17: `for-in` is faster than others. This is probably because of CPU cache size. traditional `for` is **faster** than `for-of`.

- ES5 and lower:Traditional `for` is **similar to** `for-of`, by `for-of` being a small touch faster. Both are much faster than `for-in`.

If you notice, you see by targeting ES5 the TypeScript compiler converts `for-of` to the `traditional-for`, and that makes it faster than the original `for-of`!! Actually, by setting `"downlevelIteration": true
`, you can make `for-of` slow in ES5 too!!!  To fix this issue you can use `npm run build` which uses `@babel/plugin-transform-for-of` to convert `for-of` to `traditional-for` ("loose" is faster than "assumeArray").

```typescript

  let sum = ""
  const keys = Object.keys(dict)
  for (let i = 0, l = keys.length; i < l; ++i) {
    sum.concat(dict[keys[i]])
  }

// for - of
  let sum = ""
  const keys = Object.keys(dict)
  for (const k of keys) {
    sum.concat(dict[k])
  }

// for - in
  let sum = ""
